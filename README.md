# Nutella Ramadan Theme Frontend Project 🌙

This is my first frontend project where I developed a Nutella-themed website with a special focus on the Ramadan season. The project showcases my skills in building dynamic, interactive, and visually appealing interfaces using modern web technologies.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Svelte**: Chose Svelte for its simplicity and to explore its differences compared to frameworks like React.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for styling the project quickly and efficiently with a utility-first approach.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For building a responsive and well-structured layout.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactivity and functionality.

## 🎯 Project Highlights
- Pixel-perfect alignment for a clean and precise UI.
- Responsive design that works across different devices and screen sizes.
- Animated elements to enhance the user experience.
- Custom theme for Nutella with Ramadan season-specific content.
